## Style Guidelines:

- The concepts of AI and architecture evoke precision and innovation, which are serious topics, so the palette will avoid bright, saturated colors. Given the need for seriousness, use a dark color scheme. The primary color will be a desaturated, yet slightly bright purple: #BFA2DB
- Background color: A dark gray, close to black, that will still permit the purple to be clearly seen. #22222A
- Accent color: A muted lavender hue to complement the primary purple without overwhelming the design: #D0BCD5
- Ensure readability across all devices. Choose fonts with a variety of weights and styles to add visual interest, while maintaining clarity.
- Incorporate simple line icons for navigation and category representation, maintaining a consistent style throughout the site.
- Utilize a grid-based layout for the portfolio and blog sections to provide a structured and visually appealing presentation of content.
- Add subtle animations for page transitions and interactive elements, enhancing user engagement without being distracting.
